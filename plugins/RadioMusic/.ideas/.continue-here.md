# Resume Point

## Current State: Creative Brief Complete

Creative brief has been finalized for RadioMusic. Ready to proceed to UI mockup or implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: MIDI-triggered sampler with continuous playback from folder
- Parameters specified: Station (file selector), Start (re-trigger point), Volume, Speed/Pitch
- UI vision captured: Large waveform display with adaptive masking, folder browser, four knobs
- Use cases identified: Creative sampling, generative composition, sound design, live performance

## Next Steps

1. Create UI mockup to visualize design (recommended)
2. Start implementation directly
3. Research similar plugins for inspiration

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: MIDI-triggered Sampler (hybrid instrument/effect)
- Core concept: Inspired by Eurorack Radio Music module - continuous folder playback with MIDI re-triggering
- Playback behavior: Always resumes from Start position (transport restart or MIDI trigger)
- Station changes: Queue new file, apply on next MIDI trigger (or immediately if free-running)
- Waveform display: Shows full file, darkens region before Start position
- File support: WAV, AIFF, MP3, FLAC, OGG - handle 100+ files
- Speed/Pitch: Coupled (tape-style), not time-stretching

**Technical Highlights:**
- Lazy loading for performance with large folders
- Stream large files from disk
- Click-free MIDI re-triggering with short fade-in
- Seamless looping

**Files Created:**
- plugins/RadioMusic/.ideas/creative-brief.md
- PLUGINS.md entry added
