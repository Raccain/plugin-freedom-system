# Resume Point

## Current State: Creative Brief Complete

Creative brief has been finalized for GrooveScout. Ready to proceed to UI mockup or implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined (audio analyzer — BPM, key, drum MIDI extraction)
- Outputs specified (BPM display + set tempo, key display, draggable MIDI clips per drum)
- Analysis mode: one-shot triggered by Analyze button
- Technical approach: band-separated onset detection, chroma/K-S key detection
- Use cases identified (reference track analysis, sample flipping)

## Next Steps

1. Create UI mockup to visualize design (recommended)
2. Start planning/implementation directly
3. Research similar plugins for inspiration

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Analysis Utility (audio passes through unchanged)
- Core concept: One-click extraction of BPM, key, kick/snare/hihat MIDI from any audio
- MIDI output: Drag-to-track from plugin UI (separate clip per drum + root chord clip)
- No file export for now
- Works on full mixes and short loops alike

**Files Created:**
