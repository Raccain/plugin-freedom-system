# Resume Point

## Current State: Stage 2 - Foundation Complete

Foundation created manually (foundation-agent not yet implemented). Basic JUCE plugin structure compiles.

## Completed So Far

**Stage 0:** ✓ Complete
- Research finished, DSP approach defined
- Files: research.md

**Stage 1:** ✓ Complete
- Complexity score: 3.8 (complex, phased implementation)
- Files: plan.md

**Stage 2:** ✓ Complete
- CMakeLists.txt created (JUCE plugin configuration)
- PluginProcessor.h/cpp created (3 parameters: drive, age, mix)
- PluginEditor.h/cpp created (temporary UI with basic sliders)
- Project structure ready for Stage 3 (shell)
- Files: CMakeLists.txt, Source/PluginProcessor.{h,cpp}, Source/PluginEditor.{h,cpp}

## Next Steps

1. ⭐ Continue to Stage 3 (Shell - verify plugin compiles and loads)
2. Review foundation code
3. Test build (requires JUCE installation)
4. Pause here

## Context to Preserve

**Complexity Breakdown:**
- 3 parameters (0.6 pts) + 4 algorithms (4 pts) + oversampling (1 pt) = 3.8
- Phased implementation required for Stage 4

**Stage 4 Phases:**
1. Saturation (tanh waveshaping with 2x oversampling)
2. Modulation (dual LFO delay line for wow/flutter)
3. Degradation (random dropout + pink noise)
4. Mix & smoothing (dry/wet blend, parameter smoothing)

**Files Created:**
- plugins/TapeAge/.ideas/research.md
- plugins/TapeAge/.ideas/plan.md

**Contract Files Verified:**
- ✓ creative-brief.md exists
- ✓ parameter-spec.md exists (3 parameters defined)
- ✓ architecture.md exists (in research.md, signal flow documented)

**Ready for:** Stage 2 (Foundation)
